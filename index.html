                    "Formula-1" (full name: " FIA Formula One World Championship " - English FIA Formula One World Championship ) is a world championship for open-wheel car racing , which takes place under the auspices of the International Automobile Federation (FIA) [1] . First of all, "formula" is a term that defines a set of rules that must be followed by all race participants.
                    The World Championship in the Formula 1 class takes place every year and consists of Grand Prix , or stages, which are held on specially built tracks or prepared city streets. At the end of the season, the winner of the championship is determined based on the results of all races. Both individual pilots and teams compete in Formula 1. The winning pilot receives the title of World Champion , and the winning team receives the Constructors' Cup .
                    The results of each track are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual world championships, one for F1 drivers and one for F1 constructors. Drivers, team constructors, sports officials, organizers and circuits must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing license issued by the FIA.          
                    Teams participating in the "Formula-1" competition use racing cars ("bodies " ) of their own production. Therefore, it is extremely important for every team to have not only a fast and stable pilot and a good strategy, but also an extremely strong design department. Currently, Formula 1 cars develop a speed of up to 360 km/h (although in recent years the FIA ​​has tried to reduce the speed by introducing new technical rules), and are able to withstand an overload of up to 5 g in turns . The number of engine revolutions is limited to 15,000 rpm [2] . However, it should be noted that during all the years of its existence, "Formula-1" has been constantly changing.
                    <img src="https://www.autocentre.ua/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/formula-1-676x390-c-default.jpg" id="Intimg">Historically, the main center of development of "Formula-1" is Europe. Most of the teams' bases and research centers are located on this continent. However, the field of the sport has expanded significantly in recent years and an increasing number of Grand Prix events are held on other continents.            
                    Since each team builds a car independently, thanks to the very high competition in the Formula 1 races, original design ideas and solutions are constantly born, which lead to the rapid progress of both the cars themselves and ordinary road cars. The most famous example of the introduction of the technology developed for "Formula-1" in serial production is the anti-skid system . This system was first used in 1990 by the Ferrari team . After its ban in Formula 1 in 1994 , car manufacturers began to implement the system on production cars.              
                    Formula 1 has a global television audience of about 527 million viewers [3] , making this sport the most popular international competition in the world. The owner of all television rights to show the competition is the Formula One Group company [4] . Annual costs in Formula 1 are estimated at billions of US dollars , and the economic effect of holding the competition is significant. The cost of designing and building intermediate-level cars is about $120 million. In addition, financial and political battles in this sport are widely covered in the media. However, since 2000 , due to the continuous increase in costs, several teams, including the teams of car manufacturers, have gone bankrupt or been bought out by other companies.
