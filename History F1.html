                    The prerequisites for Formula 1 races appeared in the 1920s and 1930s at the European Grand Prix races. Before the Second World War , the organizations that participated in the Grand Prix formulated the first regulations of the championship. It was planned to enter into force in 1941 , but due to the war that had broken out, these rules did not come into force until 1946 .
                    Formed by the FIA ​​(International Automobile Federation), in 1946 it submitted the final Formula 1 rules, which came into force in 1947 . This year is considered the beginning of the era of "Royal Auto Race - Formula 1". It was this year that competitions were held in the "Formula A" class, which provided for the working volume of atmospheric engines up to 4,500 cm³, and those equipped with a compressor - up to 1,500 cm³. This class became the forefather of the first Formula.
                    The requirements for Formula A cars allowed pre-war cars such as the Alfa-Romeo-158 or the Maserati-4CL to participate in the race.
                    In 1949 , the International Motorcycle Federation organized the first Motorsport World Championship, after which the FIA ​​followed suit. The decision to hold the Formula 1 world championships was made by the FIA ​​in 1949 at the initiative of the delegate from Italy, Antonio Brive Sforza .
                    In 1950 , the first Formula 1 Grand Prix World Championship was held. Despite the fact that a similar series was already introduced in the 1920s, 
                     historians of auto racing do not consider the earlier Championships to be Formula .
                    The first stage included in the 1950 World Championship was the British and European Grand Prix, which took place on May 13 at the former military airfield in Silverstone . It was won by Nino Farina in an Alfa Romeo , with his Alfa teammates Luigi Faggioli and Reg Parnell finishing second and third.
                    Other stages included in the Championship were the Monaco Grand Prix , the Swiss Grand Prix at Bern , the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa , the ACF (Automobile Club of France) Grand Prix at Reims and the Italian Grand Prix at Monza , as well Indianapolis 500 race .
                    According to the scoring system originally used in the World Championships, eight points were awarded to the winner of each scoring stage, six to the runner-up, four to third, three to fourth and two to fifth. An additional point was awarded to the rider who completed the fastest lap in the race. The system was changed in 1953 , when one point was awarded to the sixth-placed driver, then in 1960 , when the point for fastest lap was abolished, and in 1961 , when the number of points for a victory was increased to nine . Until 1957 , drivers who shared the steering wheel of one car shared the points they earned; after 1958year, if more than one driver drove the car, they do not earn points.
                    Giuseppe Farina and Juan-Manuel Fangio combined to win every round of the 1950 Championship (except Indianapolis ), and Farina won the first World Championship with 30 points, Fangio was second with 27, and Fagioli was third with 24 points. .
                    Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design due to the appearance of wings in the late 1960s. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics (previously used on the Chaparral 2J in the 1970s), which provided enormous downforce and significantly increased cornering speed. Also great was the aerodynamic force of pressing the car onto the track (up to five times the car's weight), extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually rigid, completely dependent on the tires for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from road surface irregularities.
